After seeing the [Slow Motion Booth](https://vimeo.com/75259949), we wanted to make the same type of video for a friend's wedding, but we also wanted to enjoy the wedding. \r\n\r\nThe video booth had to use hardware we already had, so it was built on an iPad 2 and a GoPro Hero 3 Black. It also had to be fully automated so that we only had to visit it every so often to make sure it didn't crash. In the end we came up with this [video](https://vimeo.com/79536995), and we couldn't be happier.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
